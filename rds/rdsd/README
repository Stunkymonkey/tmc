rdsd - Radio Data System daemon
===============================

What is it?
===========

The Radio Data System daemon rdsd reads raw RDS data from a 
Video4Linux radio device. It decodes this data and acts as a
server for the results.

Clients can connect to an rdsd server in two ways:
* Via TCP/IP: rdsd listens on port 4321 by default. Server 
  and client(s) can be on different machines in a network.
* Via Unix domain socket: rdsd listens on /var/tmp/rdsd.sock
  by default. Server and client(s) have to be on the same 
  machine. This is usually faster and uses less resources than
  TCP/IP.

There is a library called librds to handle all the network 
and protocol stuff. The command line client rdsquery uses
librds.

Installation
============

(see also INSTALL files in the sources)

If you compile rdsd from sources, you need to install
librds first. The header file librds.h has to be available
at compile time. At run time, librds.so is NOT needed by
rdsd at the moment. This might change in the future.
If you install rdsquery or an other client application,
you will probably have to install librds anyway.

Test
====

You can use rdsquery for testing rdsd. See the README
file in the rdsquery sources for more details.

For a low level test, you can also directly connect to
rdsd using telnet:

# telnet localhost 4321

should work as soon as rdsd is running. You can then
get the list of sources you configured in /etc/rdsd.conf
by typing:

esrc

After pressing Return, rdsd should send its source list.

If this works, you can ask for data by typing
<source number>:<data type>, for example:

0:pname

This should display the program name of the tuned 
station of your first source. Other data types you 
could try include:

rxfre  : tuner frequency
rxsig  : signal strength
rflags : Some flags (like stereo/mono), see librds.h for details
picode : Program Identification code
ptype  : Program Type identifier
pname  : Program Name
locdt  : local date/time
utcdt  : UTC date/time
rtxt   : Current radio text buffer
lrtxt  : Last complete radio text string
tmc    : Traffic Message Channel message list (numerical, experimental)
aflist : List of alternative frequencies
gstat  : RDS group statistics

If you have questions, please join the rdsd-devel mailing list (see
homepage for details). Try to avoid asking me by privat mail. Your 
chances to get a fast response are much better on the mailing list,
and others will learn from your questions, too. That's how open source
development works.
